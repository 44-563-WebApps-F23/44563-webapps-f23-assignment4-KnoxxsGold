<h4>MRS. ALVING</h4>. <p>Yes; of course he had to take the blame upon himself.</p>

<h4>MANDERS</h4>. <p>But such a piece of duplicity on his part! And towards me too!
I never could have believed it of Jacob Engstrand. I shall not fail
to take him seriously to task; he may be sure of that.--And then the
immorality of such a connection! For money--! How much did the girl
receive?</p>

<h4>MRS. ALVING</h4>. <p>Three hundred dollars.</p>

<h4>MANDERS</h4>. <p>Just think of it--for a miserable three hundred dollars, to go
and marry a fallen woman!</p>

<h4>MRS. ALVING</h4>. <p>Then what have you to say of me? I went and married a
fallen man.</p>

<h4>MANDERS</h4>. <p>Why--good heavens!--what are you talking about! A fallen man!</p>

<h4>MRS. ALVING</h4>. <p>Do you think Alving was any purer when I went with him to
the altar than Johanna was when Engstrand married her?</p>
